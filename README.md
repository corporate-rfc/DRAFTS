# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Corporate Requests For Comments (CRFCs).

CRFCs are currently experimental. If you would like to propose a draft for publication, you may do so by creating a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the [DRAFTS repository](https://github.com/corporate-rfc/DRAFTS).

## Style Guide

CRFCs mimic the [IETF RFC](https://ietf.org/standards/rfcs/) publications in style. As such, [[RFC7322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7322)] is an appropriate style guide to follow.

See [[CRFC1](https://github.com/corporate-rfc/CRFC1)] and [[CRFC2](https://github.com/corporate-rfc/CRFC2)] for examples of how [[RFC7322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7322)] was interpreted and modified.

## Draft Naming

Borrowing from [IETF Naming and Submitting Guidelines](https://www.ietf.org/standards/ids/guidelines/):

1. All draft filenames begin with "draft"
2. Document source. A string related to the name of one of the authors in some way. There are no mechanical rules for this string but objectionable or misleading strings are subject to change or removal.
3. Document name. A word or two that reflect what the draft is about.
4. Two digit decimal version number; the inital draft uses "00".

The only characters allowed in a draft filename are lowercase letters, numerals, and hyphens. Two sequential hyphens are not permitted. Draft filenames are never reused; if your intended filename exists, you must select a different one.

For example: `draft-tslominski-system-to-human-communication-00`.

## Publication Process

CRFCs are currently experimental. The publication process is currently not well defined. The intent is to have some sort of discussion and rough consensus on a draft within the [DRAFTS repository](https://github.com/corporate-rfc/DRAFTS) using the pull request system. Once rough consensus is reached, draft would be published in a separate https://github.com/corporate-rfc repository and assigned a number.
